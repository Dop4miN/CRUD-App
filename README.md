# CRUD-App

This repository is just an example of a basic CRUD-App made with the MERN stack.
To get started, you have to add your own .env file.

Example:
```
NODE_ENV = development
PORT = 5000
MONGO_URI = mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<mongo_uri>/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
JWT_SECRET = abc123
```
